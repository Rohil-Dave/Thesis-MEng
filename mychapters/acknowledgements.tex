I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Becky Stewart for her invaluable guidance and support over the last two years. She has played a pivotal role in helping me get involved in academic research and expanding my interest and knowledge in textiles and fashion.

My sincere thanks also go to Lei Ge, who provided essential insights early on in my understanding of zero-waste pattern theory, its implications, and strategies.

I am also grateful to Joy Zhou and Mingke Wang for their assistance in sewing and their support as workshop assistants.

Special thanks to Simeon Gill from the University of Manchester and the Apparel Design Engineering (ADE) group for their help in understanding the dataset and how I could apply it to this project. Their support during my visit to the Manchester campus, where I underwent a body scan, was invaluable.

I would also like to acknowledge Kamyar Hazeri for his assistance with an initial body scan using a handheld scanner.

Thank you all for your support and contributions to this project.
