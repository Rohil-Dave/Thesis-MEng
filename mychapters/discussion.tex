\section{Method Limitations}
manual measure may have error
scanning tech not as accessible

\section{Data Limitations}
self-reported data, which can be subject to biases and inaccuracies. subjective assessments of fit and comfort may vary based on personal preferences and experiences. 

controlled conditions for waste

\subsection{Workshop Study}
\subsubsection{Limited Sample Size}
Limited Data, generalising needs more test
only 8 participants only 6 finished
time resource constraints
\subsubsection{Sewing Inconsistency}


\subsubsection{Parameterisation Improvements}
pattern generalised
constants: collar, sleevehead curve, neck opening
agressive scaling factors:
neck circ should influence neck face
design should be dynamic, increase ease for circs greater than 100 cm

\section{Framework Limitations}
Limitations with CLO
Posture mode is quite static in CLO and does not allow for varied postures
So we are simulating the fit in many different natural poses
Does not give much more than a static visual representation of fit

\section{Outcome Impact and Potential}

\section{Further Work}

parameter tuning, neck, shoulder etc
building in fabric properties
automation of pipeline
other patterns
