BECKY ADVICE: "Have this include a clear summary statement of what your project aims to do and how that is evaluated" (I probably did this in abstract so need to move it here and perhaps reword abstract a bit) "Don't make the reader have to get through the full lit review before they get to learn about why you've written it."
