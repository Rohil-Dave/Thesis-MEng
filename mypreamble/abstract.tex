\chapter*{Abstract}

This report focuses on reducing waste during garment manufacturing, where \~15\% of all fabric is wasted. Designs with increased garment utility and desirability are explored. ‘Zero waste patterns’ are one such class of designs. This study looks at parameterisation of these patterns based on individual body measurements and suggests mitigation techniques like embellishments. New tools that allow end users to visualize drape and fit of the 2D patterns in 3D are investigated.

These parameterisation heuristics are tested in a workshop setting and participants’ responses to ease of tailoring as well as suitability and fit of the design are collated. Lastly, these patterns are tested on a publicly available data set of scanned body measurement and efficiencies (minimised fabric loss) were computed for industry standard bolt widths.
