	abstract = {"Zero waste pattern cutting is a bit like a puzzle. You use a pre-determined length of fabric end to end by strategically planning your pattern pieces so that everything is used and then draw them onto the fabric. By using this unique "paperless" method you can eliminate both textile and paper waste from your sewing projects and take the fear out of learning to self draft and sew your own clothing. This book includes 5 simple zero waste pattern blocks-a t-shirt, skirt, tank top, shirt, and trousers. These can then be used to make a further 15 projects by making simple changes or mixing and matching your blocks into new designs, and comes with pattern layout instructions and templates to make sizes UK 6-30/US 2-26. Once you have mastered the 5 blocks the possibilities are endless"--Publisher's description},

As part of ongoing projects at the University of Manchester the Apparel Design Engineering (ADE) team have selected 100 scans and processed them using a Size Stream body scanner, we are making the measurements of these 100 scans accessible to anyone wishing to explore body measurements and sizing systems. The selected scans are a sample of 20-30-year-old females with half identified as White British and half as Chinese. We hope the data can be used by anyone wishing to explore body scanning and human measurements and will help provide insights into the types of data and analysis possible using outputs from body scanning technology.},

The remaining four chapters explore design approaches for altering the scale and nature of consumption, including service design, localism, speed and user involvement. While each chapter is complete in and of itself, their real value comes from what they represent together: innovative ways of thinking about textiles and garments based on sustainability values and an interconnected approach to design. Including a new preface, updated content and a new conclusion reflecting and critiquing developments in the field, as well as discussing future developments, the second edition promises to provide further impetus for future change; sealing this text as the must-buy book for fashion and textiles professionals and students interested in sustainability},

This in-depth volume presents a comprehensive overview of the challenges and emerging opportunities faced by the sector, and provides strategic solutions as to how the sector can substantially accelerate sustainability. This book collates research and industry best practice to provide a 'one-stop-shop' exploring the complex and interconnected issues surrounding sustainability in fashion, clothing and textiles. The practical and digestible chapters include innovative examples and perspectives from different regions of the globe, addressing topics from policies to supply chain issues and materials innovation. Five unique case studies of sustainable businesses provide detailed examples of pioneering practice. Edited by three editors with long-standing knowledge and expertise, the book takes a global perspective with examples that illustrate the scale and breadth of topics and regions in the scope of sustainability. This holistic approach brings together both academic and industry perspectives on the critical areas that require immediate action to move towards a more sustainable fashion, clothing and textile sector. This is an invaluable resource for those working in the industry, policymakers, and for those in business or academia with an interest in sustainability in fashion, clothing, textiles and related sectors worldwide. It is also relevant to professionals and students in the areas of sustainability, innovation, supply chains, design and development, consultancy, education and training"--},

	abstract = {Pattern making is one of the most vital parts of product development in the apparel or other textile industry. However, the traditional 2D pattern-making method is tedious, abstract, and time-consuming. Although several 2D techniques are available in the current research for automatic pattern generation, most of them have been limited to fixed styles. To solve the problem in pattern making, here a new 3D pattern making approach based on graphic coding is proposed. The textile with coded graphics as a flexible coordinate is used to establish the mapping relationship between 2D patterns and 3D garments, which allows a draped 3D shape to a 2D plane. The images with micro encoding graphics of key points are acquired to obtain 2D localization information from the fabric in 3D form. Based on image processing and encoding/decoding, the pattern can be generated according to the coordinate value of key points. The approach realizes the intuitive, accurate and rapid garment pattern generation, which offers possibilities for fashion designers or other users with little expertise in 2D pattern drafting to make patterns in any constructions. Also, as it can be effective in enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of MTM (Made-to-Measure). In addition to the apparel industry, the method also shows great application potential in shoes, home textiles, flexible digital tablets, and other related areas.},

	abstract = {The fashion industry is facing increasing pressure to move toward sustainable development, especially with concern to cost and environmental sustainability. Innovative digital technologies are regarded as a promising solution for fashion companies to resolve this issue. In this context, this paper put forth a new 3D reverse garment design approach embedded with a garment fit prediction and structure self-adaptive adjustment mechanism, using machine learning (ML) techniques. Initially, the 3D basic garment was drawn directly on the scanned mannequin of a specific consumer. Next, a probabilistic neural network (PNN) was employed to predict the garment’s fit. Afterwards, genetic algorithms (GA) and support vector regression (SVR) were utilized to estimate and control the garment structural parameters following the feedback of fit evaluation and the consumer’s personalized needs. Meanwhile, a comprehensive evaluation was constructed to characterize the quantitative relationships between the consumer profile and the designed garment profile (garment fit and styles). Ultimately, the desired garment which met the consumer’s needs was obtained by performing the routine of “design–fit evaluation–pattern adjustment–comprehensive evaluation”, iteratively. The experimental results show that the proposed approach provides a new solution to develop quality personalized fashion products (garments) more accurately, economically, and in an environmentally friendly way. It is feasible to facilitate the sustainable development of fashion companies by simultaneously reducing costs and negative impacts on the environment.},
