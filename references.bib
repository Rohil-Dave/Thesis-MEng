	abstract = {This paper investigates the confict between hand crafted bespoke tailoring and computerised mass market tailoring in the UK, in order to assess the overall place for this traditional technique within fashion design. It supports a need for retaining the heritage of traditional skills practiced in bespoke tailoring and justifes this as a luxury the consumer can and should afford. The research emphasises the pedagogic approach to the delivery and understanding of tailoring technology in the fashion design courses at University of Huddersfeld. This understanding underpins the student's perception of pattern cutting, ft, sizing, proportion and an overall approach to making clothes. Fashion tutors at Huddersfeld believe that when students are taught to appreciate the luxury, heritage and skill of bespoke tailoring, it equips them with the confdence and expertise to create any type of garment. The luxury of the traditional tailoring process is in the time, craft and experience instilled into each garment. A bespoke tailor is a sculptor whose medium is cloth. He moulds a shell out of this cloth that refnes and accentuates the human form. It is a unique service in which the client's individual measurements are applied to the creation of a garment made to their exact size specifcations. Particular attention is given to the detail, quality and excellence in the work. Bespoke tailoring as a fashionable look had a revived popularity in the late 1990's and early 2000's. Many fashion designers at the cutting edge of the fashion industry such as Vivienne Westwood and Alexander McQueen pushed the look of tailoring and the craft traditions of bespoke to the forefront of directional fashion, which in turn provoked a resurgence of interest in the craft. Holding court in a 1998 interview in English Vogue, Vivienne Westwood said: "I don't understand this desperate need to always move forward. To strive for the new is the most conformist thing you can do. Everyone can tell you about what is new and clever, but no-one can tell you what is good! There is a myth that the past is irrelevant, that progress is the only thing" (Holgate, 1998). The paper analyses how the bespoke industry considers the incorporation of new and computerised technology. In so doing, it considers how the fashion industry could determine the future of tailoring. This could either be through contemporary fashion's emphasis on the idiom as a look, or in the vast advances in technological development that could enhance it, in order to make bespoke more widely available. The paper culminates by considering realistic strategies as the technology within an accessible and computerised mass market industry grows and develops. It highlights that its marketing and promotion as a luxurious craft with an un-rivalled heritage, at the cutting edge of the industry, could be the key to the customer buying into its continued existence. © Common Ground, Kevin Almond, All Rights Reserved, Permissions.},

	abstract = {The implementation of standardized grading production practices within the mass market has been challenging for scholars experimenting with zero-waste apparel design. The purpose of this research was to test the efficacy of the Carrico Zero-waste Banded Grading (CZWBG) technique, which utilizes bands inserted in strategic locations as a method of grading zero-waste patterns across various consumer categories. An additional purpose was to evaluate the ways in which this grading approach affected the aesthetic outcomes of garments across a size run, and to determine whether this method affected the overall design process of the designers involved. Through experimental research design, six design scholars successfully tested and incorporated the CZWBG technique in zero-waste one or two-piece apparel item(s), subsequently developing three sizes in an industry-specified size range for their product category. Each design was cut from zero-waste patterns in a mid-range size and graded up and down one–two sizes using an industry-standardized grading scale. The grading was achieved by varying the widths and lengths of strategically inserted bands of fabric or trim. The designers utilized various grading methods, textiles, pattern development methods, and size runs, showing that the CZWBG technique can successfully be applied across multiple consumer categories in the apparel industry.},

	abstract = {The first edition described the concept of Integrated Waste Management (IWM), and the use of Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) to provide a way to assess the environmental and economic performance of solid waste systems. Actual examples of IWM systems and published accounts of LCI models for solid waste are now appearing in the literature. To draw out the lessons learned from these experiences a significant part of this 2nd edition focuses on case studies - both of IWM systems, and of where LCI has been used to assess such systems. The 2nd edition also includes updated chapters on waste generation, waste collection, central sorting, biological treatment, thermal treatment, landfill and materials recycling. This 2nd edition also provides a more user-friendly model (IWM-2) for waste managers. To make it more widely accessible, this edition provides the new tool in Windows format, with greatly improved input and output features, and the ability to compare different scenarios. A detailed user's guide is provided, to take the reader through the use of the IWM-2 model, step by step. IWM-2 is designed to be an "entry level" LCI model for solid waste - user-friendly and appropriate to users starting to apply life cycle thinking to waste systems - while more expert users will also find many of the advanced features of the IWM-2 model helpful. IWM-2 is delivered on CD inside the book. © 2001 Procter \& Gamble Technical Centres Limited. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This thesis examines zero-waste fashion design: design activity that results in zero-waste garments. Conventional design approaches waste approximately 15 per cent of the fabric used in the design and make of a cut and sew garment. The responsibility for this wastage belongs with manufacture, which is constrained by what has already been designed and pattern cut. The economic systems that underpin fashion design and manufacture are such that there is little economic incentive to be concerned with this wastage. An examination of the material and social investments embodied in fabrics alongside their environmental impacts, reveals that these investments are wasted in the wasted fabric. 
The context of this study is contemporary fashion design within the ready-to-wear industry: fashion design that leads to the manufacturing of multiples of one design. The contextual review of this study examines different methods of fashion creation. Design ideation tools and the relationship between fashion design and pattern cutting in current industry provide the frame for design practice in this study, together with an analysis of historical and contemporary zero-waste and less-waste garments. Findings from the contextual review frame a series of briefs for design experiments. This study asks: What are the opportunities for creating zero-waste garments within contemporary menswear fashion design practice using cut and sew methods? 
Fashion design practice is the primary research tool in this study. Design processes and their outcomes are documented in a journal, and the journals are transcribed and analysed. Successful strategies for zero-waste fashion design, emerging from the data, are presented. Pattern cutting emerges as integral to zero-waste fashion design. Zero-waste fashion design is examined in relation to fashion manufacture, as particular manufacturing issues such as fabric as material, and the grading of garment patterns to achieve size ranges of garments, create new kinds of opportunities for zero-waste fashion design. This study also asks: To what extent is a zero-waste approach feasible and desirable within contemporary fashion industry? This study demonstrates that zero-waste fashion design generates new opportunities for fashion design to engage with fashion manufacture that may not currently exist. 
This study calls for fashion design to consider pattern cutting an integral part of the fashion design process. Such an approach to fashion design creates new opportunities for the fashion industry and fashion design education. Zero-waste fashion design is part of a larger picture of beauty for everyone, that fashion is capable of being the source of.},

Transitioning to a CE in the Fashion Textiles Industry (FTI) requires a holistic policy approach through comprehensive and coherent policy interventions across the resource life cycle. This paper introduces the novel Circular Policy Canvas tool to systematically and visually map CE policies across six dimensions (policy environment, resource life cycle, CE loop, CE strategy, system element and circular business model). This is applied to thirty FTI policies in the EU policy landscape. The canvas enables policymakers and researchers to assess policies to identify gaps and priorities for CE policy development. The findings determine the recency of the EU policy agenda for a circular FTI meaning that there are gaps in terms of coverage and coherence. In particular, the study identifies a lack of attention to displacing the linear economy, a concentration of policies in the head and tail of the resource life cycle with gaps in the core, a dominance of policies in the outer over the inner loop and inadequate coverage of policies focused on actors, infrastructure and resources.},

	abstract = {Garment modeling is an essential task of the global apparel industry and a core part of digital human modeling. Realistic representation of garments with valid sewing patterns is key to their accurate digital simulation and eventual fabrication. However, little-to-no computational tools provide support for bridging the gap between high-level construction goals and low-level editing of pattern geometry, e.g., combining or switching garment elements, semantic editing, or design exploration that maintains the validity of a sewing pattern. We suggest the first DSL for garment modeling - GarmentCode - that applies principles of object-oriented programming to garment construction and allows designing sewing patterns in a hierarchical, component-oriented manner. The programming-based paradigm naturally provides unique advantages of component abstraction, algorithmic manipulation, and free-form design parametrization. We additionally support the construction process by automating typical low-level tasks like placing a dart at a desired location. In our prototype garment configurator, users can manipulate meaningful design parameters and body measurements, while the construction of pattern geometry is handled by garment programs implemented with GarmentCode. Our configurator enables the free exploration of rich design spaces and the creation of garments using interchangeable, parameterized components. We showcase our approach by producing a variety of garment designs and retargeting them to different body shapes using our configurator. The library and garment configurator are available at https://github.com/maria-korosteleva/GarmentCode.},

	abstract = {Objective:
This study presents anthropometric data for individuals with high body mass index (BMI). Modified anthropometric dimensions were also developed to address the challenges of obtaining accurate and repeatable data for this population segment.

Background:
The prevalence of obesity affects approximately 40\% of the U.S. adult population. Anthropometric data are needed to guide product design and safety, but few individuals with high BMI have been measured in available datasets.

Method:
Anthropometric data for a convenience sample of 288 adults with high BMI (≥30 kg/m2) were collected. To increase participation and minimize participant discomfort, measurements were collected at three bariatric weight loss clinics and one academic research institution.

Results:
The current obese cohort are heavier than the U.S. general population, with a difference in mean body weight of 47 kg for women and 56 kg for men. The obese cohort are also heavier and have a higher BMI compared with the NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) truck driver population. Waist circumferential measures of the current obese cohort were larger than women or men in either population compared, a result indicative of meaningful body shape differences.

Conclusion:
To our knowledge, this study is the first to collect anthropometric data for the obese population segment and conduct comparisons to the U.S. general population and available occupational databases. The obese cohort differed substantially with respect to the distributions of anthropometric variables.

Application:
These data provide insights about the obese population segment that are relevant to product design, and establish a foundation for future data collection efforts.},

The aim of this paper is to explore and elaborate on the interaction between dressed bodies and architectural structures and outline an alternative approach to understanding the different aesthetic forces at play in the constitution of public space. Using a photographic series of piloted experimental sites, this paper points out how the aesthetics of fashion enrich, contribute to, and change the aesthetics of urban architectural environments.

As part of ongoing projects at the University of Manchester the Apparel Design Engineering (ADE) team have selected 100 scans and processed them using a Size Stream body scanner, we are making the measurements of these 100 scans accessible to anyone wishing to explore body measurements and sizing systems. The selected scans are a sample of 20-30-year-old females with half identified as White British and half as Chinese. We hope the data can be used by anyone wishing to explore body scanning and human measurements and will help provide insights into the types of data and analysis possible using outputs from body scanning technology.},

	abstract = {Pattern making is one of the most vital parts of product development in the apparel or other textile industry. However, the traditional 2D pattern-making method is tedious, abstract, and time-consuming. Although several 2D techniques are available in the current research for automatic pattern generation, most of them have been limited to fixed styles. To solve the problem in pattern making, here a new 3D pattern making approach based on graphic coding is proposed. The textile with coded graphics as a flexible coordinate is used to establish the mapping relationship between 2D patterns and 3D garments, which allows a draped 3D shape to a 2D plane. The images with micro encoding graphics of key points are acquired to obtain 2D localization information from the fabric in 3D form. Based on image processing and encoding/decoding, the pattern can be generated according to the coordinate value of key points. The approach realizes the intuitive, accurate and rapid garment pattern generation, which offers possibilities for fashion designers or other users with little expertise in 2D pattern drafting to make patterns in any constructions. Also, as it can be effective in enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of MTM (Made-to-Measure). In addition to the apparel industry, the method also shows great application potential in shoes, home textiles, flexible digital tablets, and other related areas.},

	abstract = {The fashion industry is facing increasing pressure to move toward sustainable development, especially with concern to cost and environmental sustainability. Innovative digital technologies are regarded as a promising solution for fashion companies to resolve this issue. In this context, this paper put forth a new 3D reverse garment design approach embedded with a garment fit prediction and structure self-adaptive adjustment mechanism, using machine learning (ML) techniques. Initially, the 3D basic garment was drawn directly on the scanned mannequin of a specific consumer. Next, a probabilistic neural network (PNN) was employed to predict the garment’s fit. Afterwards, genetic algorithms (GA) and support vector regression (SVR) were utilized to estimate and control the garment structural parameters following the feedback of fit evaluation and the consumer’s personalized needs. Meanwhile, a comprehensive evaluation was constructed to characterize the quantitative relationships between the consumer profile and the designed garment profile (garment fit and styles). Ultimately, the desired garment which met the consumer’s needs was obtained by performing the routine of “design–fit evaluation–pattern adjustment–comprehensive evaluation”, iteratively. The experimental results show that the proposed approach provides a new solution to develop quality personalized fashion products (garments) more accurately, economically, and in an environmentally friendly way. It is feasible to facilitate the sustainable development of fashion companies by simultaneously reducing costs and negative impacts on the environment.},
